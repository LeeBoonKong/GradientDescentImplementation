# GradientDescentImplementation
Custom Implementation of the Gradient Descent Function  

# What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient Descent is a method of optimization, in order to minimize error of a function, by searching for the suitable parameters.  
In a simple straight line
Y = mX + b
where
m is the gradient, and b is the bias(or Y-intercept).  
X, and Y are corresponding values in a graph.

In gradient descent, we try to find the value of m and b, which results in the smallest error( using Mean Squared Error), that are able to generalize the graph with X plots and Y plots.
From a graph of MSE, be can know that it is a parabolic graph( because it is squared), and the bottom of the parabola, or minimum point, is the lowest value of error.
